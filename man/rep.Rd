\usage{
rep(data, tree)
}
\arguments{

\item{tree}{A \code{phylo} object that can be loaded using \code{ape::read.tree} for NEWICK files or \code{TreeTools::ReadTntTree} for TNT files.}
}
\description{
Given one alignment and one tree with Goodman-Bremer (GB) support values, compute the ratio of explanatory power (REP) using equally weighted parsimony.
}
\details{
Grant & Kluge (2007, 2010) proposed REP as a new measure of optimality-based support, in which support values follow the same rank order from GB. In contrast, REP has the advantage of normalizing GB values by the maximum GB. Thus, REP is comparable across datasets. REP is calculated as:
\deqn{REP} = \frac{S' - S}{X - S} = \frac{\mathrm{GB}}{\mathrm{GB}_{\max}}
The maximum value of GB can be calculated using the least parsimonious binary tree (obtained by searching with all characters weighted -1), as this allow groups in the worst tree to contradict with the groups in the best tree.
